Completed AP CS sophmore year (2020-2021) and Scored a 5


Some Tips:
- Practice as many past FRQs as possible, they are your friend
- Do many questions involving for loops, arrays, and 2D arrays, Collegeboard loves these types of questions
- I would recommend getting a book on AP CS that has practice questions like Barrons(a bit harder than the exam questions). Also, 5 Steps to a 5 is pretty good.
