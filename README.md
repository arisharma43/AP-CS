Completed AP CS sophmore year (2020-2021) and scored a 5 on the AP exam


Some Tips:
- Practice as many past FRQs as possible, they are your friend.
- Do many questions involving for loops, arrays, and 2D arrays. Collegeboard loves these types of questions.
- I would recommend getting a book on AP CS that has practice questions like Barron's (a bit harder than the exam questions). Also, 5 Steps to a 5 is pretty good.
